# What Are Containers and Why Should I Use Them?

This first chapter will introduce you to the world of containers and their orchestration. This book starts from the very beginning, in that it assumes that you have no prior knowledge of containers, and will give you a very practical introduction to the topic.

In this chapter, we will focus on the software supply chain and the friction within it. Then, we'll present containers, which are used to reduce this friction and add enterprise-grade security on top of it. We'll also look into how containers and the ecosystem around them are assembled. We'll specifically point out the distinction between the upstream Open Source Software (OSS) components, united under the code name Moby, that form the building blocks of the downstream products of Docker and other vendors.

# Summary
In this chapter, we looked at how containers can massively reduce friction in the software supply chain and, on top of that, make the supply chain much more secure.

In the next chapter, we will learn how to prepare our personal or working environment such as that we can work efficiently and effectively with Docker. So, stay tuned.
