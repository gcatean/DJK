# **The tasks of an orchestrator**

So, what are the tasks that we expect an orchestrator worth its money to execute for us? Let's look at them in detail. The following list shows the most important tasks that, at the time of writing, enterprise users typically expect from their orchestrator.

# Reconciling the desired state

When using an orchestrator, you tell it, in a declarative way, how you want it to run a given application or application service. We learned  what declarative versus imperative means in, Docker Compose. Part of this declarative way of describing the application service that we want to run includes elements such as which container image to use, how many instances of this service to run, which ports to open, and more. This declaration of the properties of our application service is what we call the desired state.

So, when we now tell the orchestrator for the first time to create such a new application service based on the declaration, then the orchestrator makes sure to schedule as many containers in the cluster as requested. If the container image is not yet available on the target nodes of the cluster where the containers are supposed to run, then the scheduler makes sure that they're first downloaded from the image registry. Next, the containers are started with all the settings, such as networks to which to attach, or ports to expose. The orchestrator works as hard as it can to exactly match, in reality, the cluster to the declaration.

Once our service is up and running as requested, that is, it is running in the desired state, then the orchestrator continues to monitor it. Each time the orchestrator discovers a discrepancy between the actual state of the service and its desired state, it again tries its best to reconcile the desired state.

What could such a discrepancy between the actual and desired states of an application service be? Well, let's say one of the replicas of the service, that is, one of the containers, crashes due to, say, a bug, then the orchestrator will discover that the actual state differs from the desired state in the number of replicas: there is one replica missing. The orchestrator will immediately schedule a new instance to another cluster node, which replaces the crashed instance. Another discrepancy could be that there are too many instances of the application service running, if the service has been scaled down. In this case, the orchestrator will just randomly kill as many instances as needed in order to achieve parity between the actual and the desired number of instances. Yet another discrepancy could be when the orchestrator discovers that there is an instance of the application service running a wrong (maybe old) version of the underlying container image. By now, you should get the picture, right?

Thus, instead of us actively monitoring our application's services that are running in the cluster and correcting any deviation from the desired state, we delegate this tedious task to the orchestrator. This works very well provided we use a declarative and not an imperative way of describing the desired state of our application services. 

# Replicated and global services
There are two quite different types of services that we might want to run in a cluster that is managed by an orchestrator. They are replicated and global services. A replicated service is a service that is required to run in a specific number of instances, say 10. A global service, in turn, is a service that is required to have exactly one instance running on every single worker node of the cluster. I have used the term worker node here. In a cluster that is managed by an orchestrator, we typically have two types of nodes, managers and workers. A manager node is usually exclusively used by the orchestrator to manage the cluster and does not run any other workload. Worker nodes, in turn, run the actual applications.

So, the orchestrator makes sure that, for a global service, an instance of it is running on every single worker node, no matter how many there are. We do not need to care about the number of instances, but only that on each node, it is guaranteed to run a single instance of the service.

Once again, we can fully rely on the orchestrator to handle this. In a replicated service, we will always be guaranteed to find the exact desired number of instances, while for a global service, we can be assured that on every worker node, there will always run exactly one instance of the service. The orchestrator will always work as hard as it can to guarantee this desired state.

**Note:**In Kubernetes, a global service is also called a DaemonSet.

# Service discovery
When we describe an application service in a declarative way, we are never supposed to tell the orchestrator on which cluster nodes the different instances of the service have to run. We leave it up to the orchestrator to decide which nodes best fit this task.

It is, of course, technically possible to instruct the orchestrator to use very deterministic placement rules, but this would be an anti-pattern, and is not recommended at all, other than in very special edge cases.

So, if we now assume that the orchestration engine has complete and free will as to where to place individual instances of the application service and, furthermore, that instances can crash and be rescheduled by the orchestrator to different nodes, then we will realize that it is a futile task for us to keep track of where the individual instances are running at any given time. Even better, we shouldn't even try to know this, since it is not important.

OK, you might say, but what about if I have two services, A and B, and Service A relies on Service B; shouldn't any given instance of Service A know where it can find an instance of Service B? 

Here, I have to say loudly and clearlyâ€”no, it shouldn't. This kind of knowledge is not desirable in a highly distributed and scalable application. Rather, we should rely on the orchestrator to provide us with the information that we need in order to reach the other service instances that we depend on. It is a bit like in the old days of telephony, when we could not directly call our friends, but had to call the phone company's central office, where some operator would then route us to the correct destination. In our case, the orchestrator plays the role of the operator, routing a request coming from an instance of Service A to an available instance of Service B. This whole process is called **service discovery**. 

# Routing
We have learned so far that in a distributed application, we have many interacting services. When Service A interacts with Service B, it happens through the exchange of data packets. These data packets need to somehow be funneled from Service A to Service B. This process of funneling the data packets from a source to a destination is also called **routing**. As authors or operators of an application, we do expect the orchestrator to take over this task of routing. As we will see in later chapters, routing can happen on different levels. It is like in real life. Suppose you're working in a big company in one of their office buildings. Now, you have a document that needs to be forwarded to another employee of the company. The internal post service will pick up the document from your outbox, and take it to the post office located in the same building. If the target person works in the same building, the document can then be directly forwarded to that person. If, on the other hand, the person works in another building of the same block, the document will be forwarded to the post office in that target building, from where it is then distributed to the receiver through the internal post service. Thirdly, if the document is targeted at an employee working in another branch of the company that is located in a different city or even country, then the document is forwarded to an external postal service such as UPS, which will transport it to the target location, from where, once again, the internal post service takes over and delivers it to the recipient.

Similar things happen when routing data packets between application services that are running in containers. The source and target containers can be located on the same cluster node, which corresponds to the situation where both employees work in the same building. The target container can be running on a different cluster node, which corresponds to the situation where the two employees work in different buildings of the same block. Finally, the third situation is when a data packet comes from outside of the cluster and has to be routed to the target container that is running inside the cluster. 

All these situations, and more, have to be handled by the orchestrator.

# Load balancing
In a highly available distributed application, all components have to be redundant. That means that every application service has to be run in multiple instances, so that if one instance fails, the service as a whole is still operational.

To make sure that all instances of a service are actually doing work and are not just sitting around idle, you have to make sure that the requests for service are distributed equally to all the instances. This process of distributing workload among service instances is called load balancing. Various algorithms exist for how the workload can be distributed. Usually, a load balancer works using the so-called round robin algorithm, which makes sure that the workload is distributed equally to the instances using a cyclic algorithm.

Once again, we expect the orchestrator to take care of the load balancing requests from one service to another, or from external sources to internal services.

# Scaling
When running our containerized, distributed application in a cluster that is managed by an orchestrator, we additionally want an easy way to handle expected or unexpected increases in workload. To handle an increased workload, we usually just schedule additional instances of a service that is experiencing this increased load. Load balancers will then automatically be configured to distribute the workload over more available target instances.

But in real-life scenarios, the workload varies over time. If we look at a shopping site such as Amazon, it might have a high load during peak hours in the evening, when everyone is at home and shopping online; it may experience extreme loads during special days such as Black Friday; and it may experience very little traffic early in the morning. Thus, services need to not just be able to scale up, but also to scale down when the workload goes down.

We also expect orchestrators to distribute the instances of a service in a meaningful way when scaling up or down. It would not be wise to schedule all instances of the service on the same cluster node, since, if that node goes down, the whole service goes down. The scheduler of the orchestrator, which is responsible for the placement of the containers, needs to also consider not placing all instances into the same rack of computers, since, if the power supply of the rack fails, again, the whole service is affected. Furthermore, service instances of critical services should even be distributed across data centers in order to avoid outages. All these decisions, and many more, are the responsibility of the orchestrator.

**Note:** In the cloud, instead of computer racks, the term 'availability zones' is often used.

# Self-healing
These days, orchestrators are very sophisticated and can do a lot for us to maintain a healthy system. Orchestrators monitor all containers that are running in the cluster, and they automatically replace crashed or unresponsive ones with new instances. Orchestrators monitor the health of cluster nodes, and take them out of the scheduler loop if a node becomes unhealthy or is down. A workload that was located on those nodes is automatically rescheduled to different available nodes.

All these activities, where the orchestrator monitors the current state and automatically repairs the damage or reconciles the desired state, lead to a so-called **self-healing** system. We do not, in most cases, have to actively engage and repair damage. The orchestrator will do this for us automatically.

However, there are a few situations that the orchestrator cannot handle without our help. Imagine a situation where we have a service instance running in a container. The container is up and running and, from the outside, looks perfectly healthy. But, the application running inside it is in an unhealthy state. The application did not crash, it just is not able to work as it was originally designed anymore. How could the orchestrator possibly know about this without us giving it a hint? It can't! Being in an unhealthy or invalid state means something completely different for each application service. In other words, the health status is service dependent. Only the authors of the service, or its operators, know what health means in the context of a service.

Now, orchestrators define seams or probes, over which an application service can communicate to the orchestrator about what state it is in. 

Two fundamental types of probe exist:
- The service can tell the orchestrator that it is healthy or not
- The service can tell the orchestrator that it is ready or temporarily unavailable


How the service determines either of the preceding answers is totally up to the service. The orchestrator only defines how it is going to ask, for example, through an **HTTP GET** request, or what type of answers it is expecting, for example, **OK** or **NOT OK**.

If our services implement logic in order to answer the preceding health or availability questions, then we have a truly self-healing system, since the orchestrator can kill unhealthy service instances and replace them with new healthy ones, and it can take service instances that are temporarily unavailable out of the load balancer's round robin.

# Zero downtime deployments
These days, it gets harder and harder to justify a complete downtime for a mission-critical application that needs to be updated. Not only does that mean missed opportunities, but it can also result in a damaged reputation for the company. Customers using the application are no longer prepared to accept such an inconvenience, and will turn away quickly. Furthermore, our release cycles get shorter and shorter. Where, in the past, we would have one or two new releases per year, these days, a lot of companies update their applications multiple times a week, or even multiple times per day.

The solution to that problem is to come up with a zero downtime application update strategy. The orchestrator needs to be able to update individual application services, batch-wise. This is also called **rolling updates**. At any given time, only one or a few of the total number of instances of a given service are taken down and replaced by the new version of the service. Only if the new instances are operational, and do not produce any unexpected errors or show any misbehavior, will the next batch of instances be updated. This is repeated until all instances are replaced with their new version. If, for some reason, the update fails, then we expect the orchestrator to automatically roll the updated instances back to their previous version.

Other possible zero downtime deployments are blueâ€“green deployments and canary releases. In both cases, the new version of a service is installed in parallel with the current, active version. But initially, the new version is only accessible internally. Operations can then run smoke tests against the new version, and when the new version seems to be running just fine, then, in the case of a blueâ€“green deployment, the router is switched from the current blue version, to the new green version. For some time, the new green version of the service is closely monitored and, if everything is fine, the old blue version can be decommissioned. If, on the other hand, the new green version does not work as expected, then it is only a matter of setting the router back to the old blue version in order to achieve a complete rollback.

In the case of a canary release, the router is configured in such a way that it funnels a tiny percentage, say **1%**, of the overall traffic through the new version of the service, while **99%**of the traffic is still routed through the old version. The behavior of the new version is closely monitored and compared to the behavior of the old version. If everything looks good, then the percentage of the traffic that is funneled through the new service is slightly increased. This process is repeated until 100% of the traffic is routed through the new service. If the new service has run for a while and everything looks good, then the old service can be decommissioned.

Most orchestrators support at least the rolling update type of zero downtime deployment out of the box. Blueâ€“green deployments and canary releases are often quite easy to implement.

# Affinity and location awareness
Sometimes, certain application services require the availability of dedicated hardware on the nodes on which they run. For example, I/O-bound services require cluster nodes with an attached high-performance **solid-state drive (SSD)**, or some services that are used for machine learning, or similar, require an **Accelerated Processing Unit (APU)**. Orchestrators allow us to define node affinities per application service. The orchestrator will then make sure that its scheduler only schedules containers on cluster nodes that fulfill the required criteria.

Defining an affinity to a particular node should be avoided; this would introduce a single point of failure and thus compromise high availability. Always define a set of multiple cluster nodes as the target for an application service.

Some orchestration engines also support what is called **location awareness** or **geo awareness**. What this means is that you can ask the orchestrator to equally distribute instances of a service over a set of different locations. You could, for example, define a **datacenter** label, with the possible **west**, **center**, and **east** values, and apply the label to all of the cluster nodes with the value that corresponds to the geographical region in which the respective node is located. Then, you instruct the orchestrator to use this label for the geo awareness of a certain application service. In this case, if you request nine replicas of the service, then the orchestrator would make sure that three instances are deployed to the nodes in each of the three data centersâ€”west, center, and east.

Geo awareness can even be defined hierarchically; for example, you can have a data center as the top-level discriminator, followed by the availability zone.

Geo awareness, or location awareness, is used to decrease the probability of outages due to power supply failures or data center outages. If the application instances are distributed across nodes, availability zones, or even data centers, it is extremely unlikely that everything will go down at once. One region will always be available.

# Security
These days, security in IT is a very hot topic. Cyber warfare is at an all-time high. Most high-profile companies have been victims of hacker attacks, with very costly consequences. One of the worst nightmares of each chief information officer (CIO) or chief technology officer (CTO) is to wake up in the morning and hear in the news that their company has become a victim of a hacker attack, and that sensitive information has been stolen or compromised.

To counter most of these security threats, we need to establish a secure software supply chain, and enforce security defense in depth. Let's look at some of the tasks that you can expect from an enterprise-grade orchestrator.

# Secure communication and cryptographic node identity
First and foremost, we want to make sure that our cluster that is managed by the orchestrator is secure. Only trusted nodes can join the cluster. Each node that joins the cluster gets a cryptographic node identity, and all communication between the nodes must be encrypted. For this, nodes can use **Mutual Transport Layer Security (MTLS)**. In order to authenticate nodes of the cluster with each other, certificates are used. These certificates are automatically rotated periodically, or on request, to protect the system in case a certificate is leaked.

The communication that happens in a cluster can be separated into three types. You talk about communication planesâ€”management, control, and data planes:

- The management plane is used by the cluster managers, or masters, to, for example, schedule service instances, execute health checks, or create and modify any other resources in the cluster, such as data volumes, secrets, or networks.
- The control plane is used to exchange important state information between all nodes of the cluster. This kind of information is, for example, used to update the local IP tables on clusters, which are used for routing purposes.
- The data plane is where the actual application services communicate with each other and exchange data.
Normally, orchestrators mainly care about securing the management and control plane. Securing the data plane is left to the user, although the orchestrator may facilitate this task.

# Secure networks and network policies
When running application services, not every service needs to communicate with every other service in the cluster. Thus, we want the ability to sandbox services from each other, and only run those services in the same networking sandbox that absolutely need to communicate with each other. All other services and all network traffic coming from outside of the cluster should have no possibility of accessing the sandboxed services.

There are at least two ways in which this network-based sandboxing can happen. We can either use a software-defined network (SDN) to group application services, or we can have one flat network, and use network policies to control who does and does not have access to a particular service or group of services. 

# Role-based access control (RBAC)
One of the most important tasks (next to security) that an orchestrator must fulfill in order to make it enterprise-ready is to provide role-based access to the cluster and its resources. RBAC defines how subjects, users, or groups of users of the system, organized into teams, and so on, can access and manipulate the system. It makes sure that unauthorized personnel cannot do any harm to the system, nor can they see any of the available resources in the system that they're not supposed to know of or see.

**Note:** A typical enterprise might have user groups such as Development, QA, and Prod, and each of those groups can have one or many users associated with it. John Doe, the developer, is a member of the Development group and, as such, can access resources that are dedicated to the development team, but he cannot access, for example, the resources of the Prod team, of which Ann Harbor is a member. She, in turn, cannot interfere with the Development team's resources.

One way of implementing RBAC is through the definition of **grants**. A grant is an association between a subject, a role, and a resource collection. Here, a role is comprised of a set of access permissions to a resource. Such permissions can be to create, stop, remove, list, or view containers; to deploy a new application service; to list cluster nodes or view the details of a cluster node; and many more. 

A resource collection is a group of logically related resources of the cluster, such as application services, secrets, data volumes, or containers.

# Secrets
In our daily life, we have loads of secrets. Secrets are information that is not meant to be publicly known, such as the username and password combination that you use to access your online bank account, or the code to your cell phone or your locker at the gym.

When writing software, we often need to use secrets, too. For example, we need a certificate to authenticate our application service with the external service that we want to access, or we need a token to authenticate and authorize our service when accessing some other API. In the past, developers, for convenience, have just hardcoded those values, or put them in clear text in some external configuration files. There, this very sensitive information has been accessible to a broad audience, which, in reality, should never have had the opportunity to see those secrets.

Luckily, these days, orchestrators offer what's called secrets to deal with such sensitive information in a highly secure way. Secrets can be created by authorized or trusted personnel. The values of those secrets are then encrypted and stored in the highly available cluster state database. The secrets, since they are encrypted, are now secure at rest. Once a secret is requested by an authorized application service, the secret is only forwarded to the cluster nodes that actually run an instance of that particular service, and the secret value is never stored on the node but mounted into the container in a **tmpfs** RAM-based volume. Only inside the respective container is the secret value available in clear text.

We already mentioned that the secrets are secure at rest. Once they are requested by a service, the cluster manager, or master, decrypts the secret and sends it over the wire to the target nodes. So, what about the secrets being secure in transit? Well, we learned earlier that the cluster nodes use MTLS for their communication, and so the secret, although transmitted in clear text, is still secure, since data packets will be encrypted by MTLS. Thus, secrets are secure both at rest and in transit. Only services that are authorized to use secrets will ever have access to those secret values.

# Content trust
For added security, we want to make sure that only trusted images run in our production cluster. Some orchestrators allow us to configure a cluster so that it can only ever run signed images. Content trust and signing images is all about making sure that the authors of the image are the ones that we expect them to be, namely, our trusted developers or, even better, our trusted CI server. Furthermore, with content trust, we want to guarantee that the image that we get is fresh, and is not an old and maybe vulnerable image. And finally, we want to make sure that the image cannot be compromised by malicious hackers in transit. The latter is often called a **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attack.

By signing images at the source, and validating the signature at the target, we can guarantee that the images that we want to run are not compromised.

# Reverse uptime
The last point I want to discuss in the context of security is reverse uptime. What do we mean by that? Imagine that you have configured and secured a production cluster. On this cluster, you're running a few mission-critical applications of your company. Now, a hacker has managed to find a security hole in one of your software stacks, and has gained root access to one of your cluster nodes. That alone is already bad enough but, even worse, this hacker could now mask their presence on this node, on which they have root access, after all, and then use it as a base to attack other nodes in your cluster.

**Note:** Root access in Linux or any Unix-type operating system means that you can do anything on this system. It is the highest level of access that someone can have. In Windows, the equivalent role is that of an administrator.

But what if we leverage the fact that containers are ephemeral and cluster nodes are quickly provisioned, usually in a matter of minutes if fully automated? We just kill each cluster node after a certain uptime of, say, 1 day. The orchestrator is instructed to drain the node and then exclude it from the cluster. Once the node is out of the cluster, it is torn down and replaced by a freshly provisioned node.

That way, the hacker has lost their base and the problem has been eliminated. This concept is not yet broadly available, though, but to me it seems to be a huge step toward increased security and, as far as I have discussed it with engineers who are working in this area, it is not difficult to implement.

# Introspection
So far, we have discussed a lot of tasks for which the orchestrator is responsible, and that it can execute in a completely autonomous way. But there is also the need for human operators to be able to see and analyze what's currently running on the cluster, and in what state or health the individual applications are. For all this, we need the possibility of introspection. The orchestrator needs to surface crucial information in a way that is easily consumable and understandable.

The orchestrator should collect system metrics from all the cluster nodes and make them accessible to the operators. Metrics include CPU, memory and disk usage, network bandwidth consumption, and more. The information should be easily available on a node-per-node basis, as well as in an aggregated form.

We also want the orchestrator to give us access to logs that are produced by service instances or containers. Even more, the orchestrator should provide us with **exec** access to each and every container if we have the correct authorization to do so. With **exec** access to containers, you can then debug misbehaving containers.

In highly distributed applications, where each request to the application goes through numerous services until it is completely handled, tracing requests is a really important task. Ideally, the orchestrator supports us in implementing a tracing strategy, or gives us some good guidelines to follow.

Finally, human operators can best monitor a system when working with a graphical representation of all the collected metrics and logging and tracing information. Here, we are speaking about dashboards. Every decent orchestrator should offer at least some basic dashboard with a graphical representation of the most critical system parameters.

However, human operators are not the only ones concerned about introspection. We also need to be able to connect external systems with the orchestrator in order to consume this information. There needs to be an API available, over which external systems can access data such as cluster state, metrics, and logs, and use this information to make automated decisions, such as creating pager or phone alerts, sending out emails, or triggering an alarm siren if some thresholds are exceeded by the system.
