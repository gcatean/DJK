# PowerShell for Windows
On a Windows computer, laptop, or server, we have multiple command-line tools available. The most familiar is the command shell. It has been available on any Windows computer for decades. It is a very simple shell. For more advanced scripting, Microsoft has developed PowerShell. PowerShell is very powerful and very popular among engineers working on Windows. On Windows 10, finally, we have the so-called Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows us to use any Linux tool, such as the Bash or Bourne shells. Apart from this, there are also other tools that install a Bash shell on Windows, for example, the Git Bash shell. In this book, all commands will use Bash syntax. Most of the commands also run in PowerShell.

Our recommendation for you is hence to either use PowerShell or any other Bash tool to work with Docker on Windows
