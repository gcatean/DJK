# Setting Up a Working Environment

In the last chapter, we learned what Docker containers are and why they're important. We learned what kinds of problems containers solve in a modern software supply chain.

In this chapter, we are going to prepare our personal or working environment to work efficiently and effectively with Docker. We will discuss in detail how to set up an ideal environment for developers, DevOps, and operators that can be used when working with Docker containers.

This chapter covers the following topics:


- [The Linux command shell](The-Linux-command-shell.md)
- [PowerShell for Windows](PowerShell-for-Windows.md)
- [Installing and using a package manager](Installing-and-using-a-package-manager.md)
- [Installing Git and cloning the code repository](Installing-Git-and-cloning-the-code-repository.md)
- [Choosing and installing a code editor](Choosing-and-installing-a-code-editor.md)
- [Installing Docker for Desktop on macOS or Windows](Installing-Docker-for-Desktop-on-macOS-or-Windows.md)
- [Installing Docker Toolbox](Installing-Docker-Toolbox.md)
- [Run Docker Cli](Run-Docker-Cli.md)
- [Installing Minikube](Installing-Minikube.md)


# Technical requirements
For this chapter, you will need a laptop or a workstation with either macOS or Windows, preferably Windows 10 Professional, installed. You should also have free internet access to download applications and permission to install those applications on your laptop.

It is also possible to follow along with this book if you have a Linux distribution as your operating system, such as Ubuntu 18.04 or newer. I will try to indicate where commands and samples differ significantly from the ones on macOS or Windows.

# Summary
In this chapter, we set up and configured our personal or working environment so that we can productively work with Docker containers. This equally applies for developers, DevOps, and operations engineers. In that context, we make sure that we use a good editor, have Docker for macOS or Docker for Windows installed, and can use docker-machine to create VMs in VirtualBox or Hyper-V, which we can then use to run and test containers.

In the next chapter, we're going to learn all of the important facts about containers. For example, we will explore how we can run, stop, list, and delete containers, but more than that, we will also dive deep into the anatomy of containers.
